              <h2>My Journey with the First Generation of Pokémon Games</h2>
              <p>Welcome to my fan page dedicated to the <b>first generation of Pokémon games</b>! As a <b>lifelong fan</b> of the Pokémon franchise, I have always had a special connection to the games that started it all. Even before the release of the first Pokémon game, I was a fan of the <b>GameBoy console</b>, which I owned and loved to play. At the time the first Pokémon anime aired on TV, I was only six years old, and my excitement for the game's release grew even stronger. When the <b>original Pokémon games</b> were finally released, I was ecstatic. I vividly remember walking into the store and seeing the different versions on display. I chose Pokémon version Red and started playing it right away. The <b>world of Kanto</b> felt alive and full of wonder, and I quickly became obsessed with catching them all. Ever since then, I have been a <b>collector of Pokémon games</b>, and the first generation remains close to my heart to this day. That's why I have created this fan page - to share my passion for these classic games with fellow fans and newcomers alike. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or a newcomer to the world of Pokémon, I hope that this page will be a valuable resource for you.</p>

                  <p>A bus opens its front doors and the bus driver asks, "Hey little buddy, do you want a ride?" Pikachu enters the bus with a happy "Pikachu" sound. The bus driver says, "Yeah, whatever." He puts his foot to the pedal and the bus starts to move, making rather intense sounds. We can see that the bus is full of Pokémon.</p>
                  <p>The bus takes a turn and stops at an auto junkyard. The bus driver gets off the bus, saying, "I'll be right back." With an evil smile, he pushes a button which starts a car crushing machine. It presses the bus into a GameBoy, on its screen you can see the upset Pokémons.</p>
                  <p>The narrator says, "Where can you catch 151 Pokémon? On your GameBoy, that's where. Pokémon GameBoy is here, with both packs you can catch them all." Meanwhile, the bus driver picks up the GameBoy and plays it with a big smile. The last shot is a GameBoy with Pokémon Red and Blue.</p>
